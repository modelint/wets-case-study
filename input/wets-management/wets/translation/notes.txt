1. In Wets.Service Transfer Request

This statement look vaguely wrong to me:

    available transit lanes ..= /R1/Transit Lane( ! /R4/Assigned Vessel )

I interpret it as a traversal from and instance of Wets across R1 to Transit Lane followed
by a traversal to the complement from Transit Lane across R4 to Assigned Vessel.
The term in parentheses seem to say that the traversal to R4 state that the R4 traversal
starts at the Wets instance, since it is my understanding that traversal paths that
start with "/" are presumed to be instances of "me". I think it should be

    (! ./R4/Assigned Vessel )

or at least that would have been clearer to me.

2. WTF

    ^direction == _up?
        first gate .= chosen transit lane/R5/Transit Lane Gate/OR7/downstream/~| :
        first gate .= chosen transit lane/R5/Transit Lane Gate/OR7/upstream/~|

OK I found the construct in the documentation -- awkward construct.

3. I think statements like:

*Vessel(License: ^new license, Transfer direction: ^direction) &R2
    *Assigned Vessel( Status: .moving) &R10 first gate, &R4 chosen transit lane

are backwards. Vessel does not refer to Assigned Vessel. It's the other way around.
I think it should be:

*Assigned Vessel(License: ^new license, Status: .moving)
    &R2 *Vessel( License: ^new license, Transfer_direction ^direction) &R10 first gate, &R4 chosen transit lane

whether the first statement is correct Scrall or not.

4. In the class collaboration diagram, the external entity events to Vessel use "vessel license"
as the parameter name. In the action language, just "license" is used. Pick one.

5. In Wets.Service Transfer Completed activity:

    Transfer completed (vessel license : ^completed license) -> VESSEL

should be:

    Transit completed (vessel license : ^completed license) -> VESSEL

6. In Transit Lane Gate.Complete Move activity:

    Move completed () -> My transit lane

should be:

    Move complete () -> My transit lane
    -------------^

7.  In Transit Lane.Assess Water Level activity:

    Start transit -> me :

should be:

    Start transfer -> me :

to match the state model diagram.
Same comment for Transit Lane.Adjust Water Level activity.



########################  Previous notes
1. Missing definition of Vessel License data type -- assumed some arbitrary string like a motor vehicle license.
2. Missing definition of Wets Name data type -- assumed some short string.
3. Suggest arrival time types be better defined and explained.
4. 2nd argument to Service Transit Request is typed as "Vessel Transfer direction",
   class model only has "Transfer direction" type,
   pick one
5. 1st argument to Service Transit Completed -- assuming "free transit lane" parameter is of type
   "Transit Lane Name"
